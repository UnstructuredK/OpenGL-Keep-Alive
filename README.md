This is an Application used to keep OpenGL working in an environment where it normally wouldn't.

It's mainly intended for use in a Virtual Machine, personally I have no other use for it.

It's extremely lightweight, using 0% of my CPU & GPU + very little of my RAM

The reason I made it was to use in a GPU Partitioned Virtual Machine to bypass Parsec/Moonlight connection disabling OpenGL stopping me from playing Minecraft & whatnot

========For hassle free use, place the .exe into the startup folder of your Virtual Machine========

Win + R

"shell:startup"

Hit Enter

Drag the .exe into the folder

Done

I'm completely new to GitHub & have no idea what I'm doing by the way so if this entire GitHub page is formatted incorrectly, forgive me yo ü¶¶‚úåÔ∏è
